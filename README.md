## MAINTAINED REPO

<strong>At one of these conditions I will start to update and maintain this repo. Or any similar one if you suggest a better one:</strong>

- 10 Stars
- 5 Stars & 10 Followers

## ROADMAP FOR FIRST COMMIT(when a condition will be met)

- [x] Update minimum Node.JS Engine version
- [x] Move from `pug` to `ejs` (pug is not updated anymore)
- [ ] Remove `klasa` to replace it completely `discord.js` (klasa is outdated and discord.js was only used for embeds.)
- [x] Update modules at their last version (updated package.json)
- [x] Remove all `node-fetch` usages(If actions can be done using built-in Node.JS Engine modules)
- [ ] Remove useless modules

Optional:

- [ ] Remove `passport-discord` to make a class for it instead ?(Maybe)
- [ ] Replace `recaptcha2` by a custom captcha, hcaptcha or another captcha system ?(will probably need a poll)
- [ ] Move from `config.json` to `.env`

After everything:

- [ ] Correct some code errors (`admin.ejs`)

Notes for the end of modifications:

- Verify all pages to be sure they are all well rendered and code is not badly rewrote
- Fix all CodeFactor issues
